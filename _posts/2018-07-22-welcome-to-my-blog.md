Just getting started!

So I've managed to get a new blog up and running. Unlike my previous blog which was heavily Cisco focussed, I'm moving back to the coding world. Though to make it interesting, I'm still a Cisco guy and I'm coding for Cisco.

There will likely be a lot more topics related to programming and languages and computer science here than about networking, I'll do my best to post a lot of useful scripts and whatnot that I put together for the purpose of networking.

I have a really interesting focus on networking. It's something which isn't particularly popular with the people at Cisco and I want to make it VERY CLEAR... I am not speaking for my employer. I have the ambition to reduce how much networking equipment companies use and more importantly, to reduce the amount of money they spend on networks. This means that instead od coding for the latest and greatest Cisco products (which I do as well) I'm focused instead on coding for Cisco products dating back to the previous millennium. I simply don't see the point in buying new hardware when the old stuff works just fine.

Network security is getting a lot easier now as well. I have an obsessive compulsive focus on security. I will never call myself a security expert as I don't really believe there is such a thing. I'm am however security competent. I believe strongly that most computer network security problems are generally related to poor network design and too many features. I believe that you can make network security almost rock solid if you solve most of the networking problems through other systems and not the network itself. I'll write more on this topic as I find time, but take some time to learn about Zero Trust Networks. It's a great start in the right direction to solve network security problems... simply assume all networks are and always will be unsecure and the make your systems account for that. Then you can use far less expensive and less modern networking equipment and focus on what matters instead.

Anyway... keeping it a little brief here. Now that my blog is up, I'll be around and I have a few articles on coding planned. I have a great project going and I want to write about it.
